<h1><strong>Who is Myiah? </strong></h1>
    <h3>My name is Myiah and I have spent the last 5 months in CodeCrews CodeSchool and it was well worth it. I have obtained a JavaScript certification as well as having had the
        opportunity to expand my network.   I have three small children which made my completion of the program more of a priority. With the mix of the soft skills and networking
        events and even some teaching opportunities CodeSchool has definitely made me more well rounded and marketable. I have been tested, motivated, and even distraught but one
        thing I haven't been is defeated. With no coding background before this program I have well exceeded my expectations as well as everyone around me. I look forward to working
        in a company where I can strengthen my skills and contribute to their community.
