<h1><strong>Who is Myiah? </strong></h1>
    <h3>Well i am not a fan of talking about myself, but I am a new software developer who is very inrested in what I do. I think I chose this course
    so that I could prove to myself that with no experience I could do this and i have well exceded my expectatrions.
    Starting off in CodeSchool it wasnt that I didnt have any confidince but more of I didnt know what to expect or anyhting.
    I have three small children which made this program that much more of a challange because I always feel like i have to work twice as hard as everyone else
    in the class due to my having to leave early on certain days or just having to help all three of them wit homework and still having time to
    complete my own. And having to go above and beyond because I really want to learn this so I couldnt cut myself any slack.
    With the mix of the soft skills and networking events and even some teaching oportunities CodeSchool has defenitly made me more well rounded and marketable.
    They didnt just teach me code they strengthend my survival skills and alligned me with the tools i need to be succesful,
    Not to mention the fact that I dont have alot of family and friends here in memphis and I now feel as if everyone in my chour is my family.
    I have neem tested, motivated, and even destraight but one thing i havent been is defeated. So if you want my honest opinion Code crew is for anyone who
    wants to better theirselfs and their community. They are a for the community organization and they produce people who understand what the imoact of someone
    who wants to help versus someone who feels obliated </h3>
