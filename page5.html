<h1>Mid-Semester Reflection Statement</h1>
<h4>Why am I here in Code School?</h4>
<p>My biggest reason for being in CodeSchool is to create a path of stability for me and my children.
    I also am here to explore my knowledge for technology and how it works.
Really I see this as a big opportunity that I would be kind of crazy to pass up </p>
<h4>What have I learned?</h4>
<p>I have learned an array of things that I am sure will help me to prosper as a succesful developer.
    Such as full on MERN stack which is MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
Im quite familiar with python, and have found it very useful when it comes to Django.
I have also learned how important it is to manage time when it comes to projects and the importants if writing out a plan before you code it
will defenitly help your code be more succesful and organized </p>
<h4>My vision as a developer?</h4>
<p>My vison as a developer are still under construction at the moment bceause at first I had this vision of how much of this i would be able to retaint
but now that I am three months in and thing seem to be easier for me than I thought, and I am seeing more sides oif the tech world i am not sure.</p>
<h4>How will this experience help me to achieve my goals?</h4>
<p>Just the fact that soft skills is making me more accountable for my finances and the knowledge that i am learnign here is transfering over to something that i
can take with me and use for the rest of my life I will say this program and expericen is helping me become the person that ive always wanted to be i just never gave myself a chance to or took the time to be.
And once i am who i need to be then I can achieve all the  gaols I have set for myself </p>
